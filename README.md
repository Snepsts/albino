This is my first C++ project that I'm doing for my own interests.

It was originally meant to be a little "game" for having fun with random number generation and simple variable modification.

Now it has expanded to writing objects, making them interact and perhaps a story. It is more of a text-based RPG now, and it is all written from scratch, mainly just for my enjoyment and betterment as a programmer.

Goals:

* A balanced system of strength, defense, magic, speed, and other stats.

* Solid classes that are also balanced.

* Progression that feels constant and rewarding.

* A complex combat system that allows for easy modification and flexible arrangements.

* Overall, a game that can be considered complete in the simplest of forms.

Bonus Goals (Not necessarily going to happen):

* Implementation outside of a console (OpenGL, etc).

* A story that at least works.

* Bosses.

* Weapons & Armor.

* Magic Damage/Defense along with Standard Damage/Defense (possiblities of hybrid classes and such).

* Other stuff probably.

I'll write more here later, but for now, enjoy.
