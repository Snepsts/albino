# Code Format
We're using K&R style for the code. K&R are right.
## Naming Conventions
This project uses snake_case.
## Tabs or Spaces?
Tabs. A tab represents one level of indentation, and will be treated as such.
Do you like 2 space tabs? Cool, you can set your editor to represent tabs as 2
spaces so I don't have to see that garbage.
